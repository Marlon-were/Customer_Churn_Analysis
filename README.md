# Customer_Churn_Analysis
A machine learning model to predict customer churn.git
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or cease using its services or products. It's often used in industries with subscription-based services, such as telecommunications, internet service providers, software as a service (SaaS), and others.

Churn rate, typically expressed as a percentage, measures the proportion of customers who stop using a company's services within a given time period. A high churn rate indicates that a significant number of customers are leaving, which can have negative implications for the company's revenue and growth.

Understanding and reducing customer churn is crucial for businesses because acquiring new customers can be more expensive than retaining existing ones. By identifying the factors that contribute to churn and implementing strategies to address them, companies can improve customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, their bottom line.

Common reasons for customer churn include poor customer service, dissatisfaction with the product or service, competitive offerings, pricing changes, and changes in customer needs or circumstances. Analyzing customer data and feedback can help businesses identify patterns and trends related to churn and develop targeted retention strategies.
